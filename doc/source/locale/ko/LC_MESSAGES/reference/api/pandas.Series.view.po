"Series are instantiated with ``dtype=float64`` by default. While "
"``numpy.ndarray.view()`` will return a view with the same data type as "
"the original array, ``Series.view()`` (without specified dtype) will try "
"using ``float64`` and may fail if the original data type size in bytes is"
" not the same."
