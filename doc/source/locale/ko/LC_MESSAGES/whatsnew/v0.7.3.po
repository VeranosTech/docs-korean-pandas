"This is a minor release from 0.7.2 and fixes many minor bugs and adds a "
"number of nice new features. There are also a couple of API changes to "
"note; these should not affect very many users, and we are inclined to "
"call them \"bug fixes\" even though they do constitute a change in "
"behavior. See the :ref:`full release notes <release>` or issue tracker on"
" GitHub for a complete list."

"In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except "

"While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to "
"some users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is "
"the right thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA "
"everywhere, including in numerical arrays, would cause a large amount of "
"problems for users. Thus, a \"practicality beats purity\" approach was "
"taken. This issue may be revisited at some point in the future."
