"This is a bug fix release from 0.9.0 and includes several new features "
"and enhancements along with a large number of bug fixes. The new features"
" include by-column sort order for DataFrame and Series, improved NA "
"handling for the rank method, masking functions for DataFrame, and "
"intraday time-series filtering for DataFrame."

"`Series.sort`, `DataFrame.sort`, and `DataFrame.sort_index` can now be "
"specified in a per-column manner to support multiple sort orders "
"(:issue:`928`)"

"`DataFrame.rank` now supports additional argument values for the "
"`na_option` parameter so missing values can be assigned either the "
"largest or the smallest rank (:issue:`1508`, :issue:`2159`)"

"DataFrame has new `where` and `mask` methods to select values according "

"DataFrame currently supports slicing via a boolean vector the same length"
" as the DataFrame (inside the `[]`). The returned DataFrame has the same "
"number of columns as the original, but is sliced on its index."

msgid ""
"If a DataFrame is sliced with a DataFrame based boolean condition (with "
"the same size as the original DataFrame), then a DataFrame the same size "
"(index and columns) as the original is returned, with elements that do "
"not meet the boolean condition as `NaN`. This is accomplished via the new"
" method `DataFrame.where`. In addition, `where` takes an optional `other`"
" argument for replacement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../whatsnew/v0.9.1.rst:81
msgid ""
"Furthermore, `where` now aligns the input boolean condition (ndarray or "
"DataFrame), such that partial selection with setting is possible. This is"
" analogous to partial setting via `.ix` (but on the contents rather than "
"the axis labels)"
